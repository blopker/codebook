This is a spell-checking tool. Files in test and example directories intentionally contain misspellings to verify the spell-checker works correctly. Word list files contain domain-specific vocabulary.

Do NOT flag spelling errors, typos, or duplicate entries in these files - they are intentional test fixtures and vocabulary lists.
