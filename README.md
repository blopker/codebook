## About

Codebook is a spellchecker for code. It binds together the venerable Tree Sitter, the spell checker Spellbook and includes a Language Server for use in any editor. Everything is done in Rust to keep response times snappy.

## Status

Codebook is being developed and not yet ready for public (or private, really) use. Hit the Star button to follow for updates though.

## Features

### Code-aware spell checking

Codebook will only check the parts of your code where a normal linter wouldn't. Comments, string literals and variable definitions for example. Codebook knows how to split camel case and snake case variables, and makes suggestions in the original case.

### Language Server

Codebook comes with a language server. Originally developed for the Zed editor, this language server can be integrated into any editor that supports the language server protocol.

### Dictionary Management

Codebook comes with a dictionary manager, which will automatically download and cache dictionaries for a large number of written languages.

## Running

Currently there are only tests.

Run them with `make test`.
