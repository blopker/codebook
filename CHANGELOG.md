[0.3.0]

Breaking changes:

- User defined regex is now run on a file line-by-line instead of word-by-word. This means regex should likely not match the beginning of a line. For example to match DNA, this pattern used to work: `^[ATCG]+$`. This pattern will now need to be something like: `\\b[ATCG]+\\b` (double `\\` is for escaping in TOML)

- Codebook will now ignore text like URLs and color hex codes by default. See README `User-Defined Regex Patterns` for more details.
